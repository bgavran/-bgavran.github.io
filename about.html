            <h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>I’m a Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)</a>, Zagreb. At the moment (April 2019) I’m on my last year of Master studies and I’m writing my thesis titled <em>Compositional Deep Learning</em>.</p>
<p>I’m interested in studying nature’s machinery using the most universal language possible.</p>
<p>I’m especially interested in understanding fundamental principles of intelligence, whatever the word <em>intelligence</em> may mean.</p>
<p>I’m a strong advocate of a compositional, rigorous, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage">category-theoretic</a> view of the world. I’m also a strong advocate of purely functional programming languages and type-driven development. I believe we should let the compiler be our guide while <em>reasoning</em> about software.</p>
<h3 id="research-philosophy">Research philosophy</h3>
<p>One of my main long-term goals is understanding <em>the fundamental principles of intelligence</em>.</p>
<p>This encompasses understanding both how the brain works and the general properties that the behavior of a machine or any sort of a system needs to exhibit in order to be classified as intelligent.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence#Definitions">have not yet reached consensus</a> on what the definition of intelligence is. However, there are still some subtle clues as to how the formalization of intelligence might look like. I outline these clues below.</p>
<p>Intelligence is <em>an abstract term</em>. It encompasses pattern recognition, knowledge representation, meta cognition, planning, perception, analogical reasoning, creativity and many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Problems">aspects of AI</a>. In order to describe a system whose behaviors exhibit properties of <em>intelligence</em> - the description can’t be specific to creativity, pattern recognition, planning or any of the other mentioned properties. The implementation needs to be on a higher level of abstraction whose <em>special cases</em> are those properties.</p>
<p>Another clue comes from deep learning. An increasing number of components of a modern deep learning system can be learned. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">Generative Adversarial Networks</a> learn the <em>cost function</em>. The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474">Learning to Learn by gradient descent by gradient descent</a> specifies networks that learn the <em>optimization function</em>. The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343">Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients</a> specifies how even the <em>gradients</em> can be learned. <strong>As more and more components of these systems stop being fixed throughout training, there is an increasingly larger need for precise formal specification of the things that <em>do</em> stay fixed. </strong> Standard methods don’t seem to be as effective: the invariants across all these networks seem to be rather abstract and hard to describe.</p>
<p>My research explores the speculation that the language of <em>category theory</em> could be well suited to make these statements more precise. By doing so, I hope to describe and quantify high-level intelligent behavior.</p>
<p>Category theory is becoming a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316">central hub for all of mathematics</a> - but is slowly finding applications in chemistry, neuroscience, causality and database theory to name a few. It is unmatched in organizing and layering abstractions across seemingly disparate disciplines.</p>
<p>I believe category theory is much more than that - we have just begun scratching the surface of <em>general reasoning</em> using category theory. Category theory and intelligence seem to be deeply linked - both are guided by the goal of organizing and layering abstractions.</p>
<p>Automation of exactly that - organizing and layering abstractions - seems to be the quest of machine learning.</p>
<p>I’m interested in categorical modelling of machine learning systems, both at a low level (automatic differentiaton, composition of differentible maps) and at a high level of abstraction (categorically modelling network architectures, training methods, as well as concepts such as ‘generalization’ and ‘analogy’).</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that it is not the case that I’m trying to impose a special “category-theoretic way” of modelling these systems; what I’m doing is trying to find the most natural, leaky-abstraction-free and composable way there is to understand these systems. It turns out that I end up doing category theory.</p>
<p>This is a vast unexplored area and I’m happy to talk about any of this stuff, feel free to drop me an <a href="./contact.html">email</a>!</p>
