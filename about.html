            <h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>I’m a Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)</a>, Zagreb. At the moment (April 2019) I’m on my last year of Master studies and I’m writing my thesis titled <em>Compositional Deep Learning</em>.</p>
<p>I’m interested in studying nature’s machinery using the most universal language possible.</p>
<p>I’m especially interested in understanding fundamental principles of intelligence, whatever the word <em>intelligence</em> may mean.</p>
<p>I’m a strong advocate of a compositional, rigorous, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage">category-theoretic</a> view of the world. I’m also a strong advocate of purely functional programming languages and type-driven development. We should let the compiler be our guide while <em>reasoning</em> about software.</p>
<h3 id="research-philosophy">Research philosophy</h3>
<p>One of my main long-term goals is understanding <em>the fundamental principles of intelligence</em>.</p>
<p>This encompasses understanding both how the brain works and the general properties that the behavior of a machine or any sort of a system needs to exhibit in order to be classified as intelligent. It is important to note that we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence#Definitions">have not yet reached consensus</a> on what the definition of intelligence is. Nevertheless, there still exist plenty of subtle clues that tell us how the general shape of the definition might look like. I roughly describe these clues below as I believe it is important to keep them in mind while searching for the definition.</p>
<p>Intelligence is <em>an abstract term</em>. It encompasses pattern recognition, natural langauge processing, knowledge representation, metacognition, planning, perception, analogical reasoning, creativity and many other aspects listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Problems">here</a>. In order to describe a system whose behaviors exhibit properties of <em>intelligence</em> - the description can’t be specific to creativity, pattern recognition, planning or any of the other mentioned properties. The implementation needs to be on a higher level of abstraction whose <em>special cases</em> are those properties.</p>
<p>All intelligent systems seem to have one thing in common: posession of an accurate internal model of the enviorment. They organize and layer various hierarchical representations of the world in order to be more efficient at its internal simulation and thus prediction of its future states. Tightly related to the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">autopoiesis</a>, these systems show a tendency not to only maintain themselves, but also to maintain their environment in a state which is compatible with their existence. One could consider these systems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_regulator">good regulators</a> which strive to become isomorphic to the environment - whatever isomorphic might mean in this context.</p>
<p>Another hint as to what intelligence really is comes from deep learning. An increasing number of components of a modern deep learning system can be learned. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">Generative Adversarial Networks</a> learn the <em>cost function</em>. The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474">Learning to Learn by gradient descent by gradient descent</a> specifies networks that learn the <em>optimization function</em>. The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343">Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients</a> specifies how <em>gradients</em> themselves can be learned. These are just rough examples, but they give a sense of things to come. <strong>As more and more components of these systems stop being fixed throughout training, there is an increasingly larger need for precise formal specification of the things that <em>do</em> stay fixed.</strong> This is not an easy task; the invariants across all these networks seem to be rather abstract and hard to describe.</p>
<p>My research explores the hypothesis that the language of <em>category theory</em> could be well suited to describe these systems in a precise manner. By doing so, I hope to describe and quantify high-level intelligent behavior.</p>
<p>Category theory is becoming a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316">central hub for all of mathematics</a> - but is slowly finding applications in chemistry, game theory, neuroscience, causality and database theory to name a few. It is unmatched in organizing and layering abstractions across seemingly disparate disciplines.</p>
<p>I believe category theory is much more than that - we have just begun scratching the surface of <em>general reasoning</em> using category theory - it guides and structures thought. Category theory and intelligence seem to be deeply linked - both are guided by the goal of <em>organizing and layering abstractions</em>. Automation of exactly that - <em>organizing and layering abstractions</em> - seems to be the quest of machine learning.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, I make my goals more precise. I want to understand how to categorically model general learning systems - with a focus on those that utilize gradient information during learning. My interests are both at a low level (automatic differentiation, composition of differentiable maps) and at a high level of abstraction (categorically modeling network architectures, training methods, as well as concepts such as ‘generalization’ and ‘analogy’). This is, of course, just the tip of the iceberg; I’m also interested in all the things one needs to know in order to implement such systems: functional programming languages, system design, optimization etc.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that it is not the case that I’m trying to impose a special “category-theoretic way” of modeling these systems; what I’m doing is trying to find the most natural, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">leaky-abstraction</a>-free and composable way there is to understand these systems. It turns out that I end up doing category theory.</p>
<p>This is a vast unexplored area and I’m happy to talk about any of this stuff, feel free to <a href="./contact.html">get in touch</a>!</p>
