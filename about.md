Computer science student at FER (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing) in Zagreb, Croatia.

I'm interested in understanding the fundamental principles of intelligence.

In order to describe such an abstract term as 'intelligence' - which encompasses pattern recognition, meta cognition, planning, analogical reasoning, creativity - one can't have a model that's tied to the specifics of any of those.
The theory needs to be on a higher level of abstraction - the level Category theory seems to provide.

Category theory is becoming a central hub for all of mathematics - but is slowly finding applications in chemistry, neuroscience, causality and database theory to name a few. It is unmatched in organizing and layering abstractions across seemingly disparate disciplines. 

Automation of exactly that - "organizing and layering abstractions" - seems to be the quest of machine learning.

I'm interested in categorical modelling of machine learning systems, both at a low level (automatic differentiaton, composition of differentible maps) and at a high level of abstraction (categorically modelling network architectures, training methods, as well as concepts such as 'generalization' and 'analogy').

It is not the case that I'm trying to impose a special "category-theoretic way" of modelling these systems; what I'm doing is trying to find the most natural, leaky-abstraction-free and composable way there is to understand these systems. It turns out that I end up doing category theory.

This is a vast unexplored area and I'm happy to talk about any of this stuff, feel free to drop me an email!
