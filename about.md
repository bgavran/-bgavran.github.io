Computer science student at FER (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing) in Zagreb, Croatia.

I'm interested in understanding the fundamental principles of intelligence.

I'm fascinated by category theory and I'm trying to formalize various neural network architectures and training methods in a categorical language.

I'm happy to talk about any of this stuff, feel free to drop me an email!

My [academic CV](/assets/Bruno_Gavranovic_CV.pdf) and [github repository](https://github.com/bgavran).
